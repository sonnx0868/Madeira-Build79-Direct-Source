/* Remote Metal transport -- shared wire protocol.
 *
 * Forwards winemetal's semantic seam to a real Metal device on a macOS host,
 * so a virtualised iOS guest can render on hardware its own paravirtual Metal
 * cannot reach (no mesh shaders, no BC, no GPU family reported at all).
 *
 * ⚠️ winemetal is a SEMANTIC seam, not a wire protocol. Two things it does
 * today are only legal because guest and host share one address space:
 *
 *   1. obj_handle_t is a raw Objective-C pointer CAST to uint64_t --
 *      `params->ret = (obj_handle_t)[array objectAtIndex:i]`. Across a machine
 *      boundary that is meaningless and unsafe, so this protocol never puts a
 *      host pointer on the wire. Handles are generation-tagged table indices.
 *   2. wmtcmd_* command lists are LINKED THROUGH GUEST POINTERS and carry
 *      further pointers for inline bytes, viewports and scissors. Those must
 *      become contiguous records with offsets before command encoding can be
 *      forwarded. This spike deliberately stops short of that.
 *
 * Synchronous request/response by design. Async completion handlers across a
 * machine boundary are how you get non-deterministic hangs, and correctness
 * comes before throughput here.
